      <b>Two Emo Roommates</b>
  <p> Friday noon, Two college roommates are ready to go for a rave. Hatley walked out of her room heading to the living room. 
    Hatley: "Hey, you ready for the rave? " <br>
  Courtney:*does not bother to look up from the console* "Just one more level, chill. "<br>
  Hatley rolls her eyes, just then their friend, named Kevin, walks into their apartment with a spear key he possessed. He wore a black tank top with blue denim baggy shorts, cowboy boots, and a scarf tied stylishly around his neck. <br>
  Kevin: "Your ride has arrived."<br>
  Hatley groans, not in the mood for his goofy personality.<br>
  Hatley: "Courtney is gonna waste time just, "<br>
    Hatley looks at him thinking of how he could make him useful. <br>
    "Just take a picture of us,"<br>
  Kevin shrugged and got out his phone, as Hatley found her way onto the couch with Courtney.</p>

        <br>
        Dear God, 
        I always wondered why I was under shelter, <br>
        With warm clothes and a family<br>
        While thy children with kinder souls<br>
        Withered away on roads or in orphanages<br>
        The begging little ones on the road<br>
        Some who only had themselves to survive<br>
        There shall never trespass against us, even be enemy<br>
        A reckoning came to light <br>
        Thee perfect child, oh lucifer <br>
        A banished child, brighter than brightest star<br>
        Thy was forsaken as punishment for being thee greedy last born?
        <br>
        Thy reflected thy pain onto the world as part of thy's revolution, the anger<br>
        Uncruel to thy to forsake the world, cruel to the world to be forsaken.

       <p> As an asthma patient, I have always been limited to means that provide little air, so least to say that is a hard life. This lead me to reminisce about nature and greenery. In a society where bush burning is common, I was inspired by the idea of contrasting what the world was years ago to the Mordernity we live in now. </p>

  <p> AP PORTFOLIO     </p>
  <p> This is a new segment where I document on my AP portfolio and the work flow behind it. My theme this year is sonder.
  </p>   <p>
    The first one I have started working on is "BC"meaning BC and it symbolizes what we are and where we come from and how we have singular paths in life. It is undone but it is my first piece.
