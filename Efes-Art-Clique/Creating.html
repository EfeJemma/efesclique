            <b>L</b>ife is strange is a popular collection of interactive multiple-choice games. First launched in 2015, keeps getting more popular, with their re-mastered versions of the older games, and new collection stories. Life is Strange was developed by Dontnod Entertainment and released to the public by Square Enix. The game quickly gains attention, following its expansion into mobile devices; the previously only available on Playstation, Xbox, and Windows. It was developed into a mobile version after gaining popularity. Life is strange is an interactive graphic adventure game, and the contents of the game fits the genre perfectly.The perfect execution of the game draws in people with interest in the interactive film/graphic, interactive adventure game genre. In the first series, the game revolves around the 18-year old aspiring photographer, returned back to her hometown for blackwell college, particularly for Mr. Jefferson, a renowned photographer with stellar works. After blending in as a quiet gifted student, she soon learns she has the power to move forward or backward into time, and to it as well. A series of life changing events ensue, after her reconnection with her old friend, chloe, who she saved with her powers marking the start of the events. The captivating cliff-hanging game details an interesting storyline with different unique characters that you learn a bit about through the game flow. A lot of qualities such as the butterfly effect, soundtracks, music, and voice acting leaves a nostalgic feeling on the players. I personally go back to play the game, and even watch edits made by the fanbase because of the nostalgia I had from the game and the interesting storyline. The game targets the emotional state of our being, and it did that very well with the storyline and other quality elements.
